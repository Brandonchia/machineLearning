## Algorithm
The algorithm is based on the report published and recommanded by World Health Organization

_For male_
```{r,results='hide'}
print ('ideal weight = ( Height - 80 ) * 0.7')
idealWeiM <- function(h) (h-80) * 0.7
```
_For female_
```{r,results='hide'}
print ('ideal weight = (Height -70) * 0.6')
idealWeiF <- function(h) (h-70) * 0.6
```
_It is good for people whose weight is between 0.9 times of and 1.1 times of ideal weight._

## Example
I'm 176 centimeter high and 70 kilogram weight,and I'm male.
```{r,results='hold'}
idealWei <-function(sex,h){
        ifelse(sex =='male',idealWeiM(h),idealWeiF(h))
}
print(paste('My ideal weight is in the interval:'))
idealWei('male',176)*0.9
idealWei('male',176)*1.1
```
